# An introductory Python for Data Science course built out of Jupyter notebooks
This repository hosts Jupyter notebook "labs" I have built as part of my volunteer work in our [prison system](https://www.boisestate.edu/physics/blog/2019/08/19/physics-student-brings-science-class-to-prison/). Recently I've been revamping all of them in an attempt to make them cleaner/more intuitive/more useful to the inmates so that it's easier for them to work on things when I'm gone, and I also thought that as I refinish them it would be a good time to immortalize them on github. If you have stumbled across this somehow and have a use for them in your own outreach/teaching, please take feel free to take and use them however you see fit!

Many thanks to Dr. Olga Goulko and Dr. Michal Kopera, whose classes I've drawn exercises and general inspiration from to use in this project.
