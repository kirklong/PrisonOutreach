    "**1. What is Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a *high level interpreted* programming language. What does this mean? Python's higher level syntax means that Python code is highly readable and much easier to intuitively understand than many lower-level langauges--this makes it a great language to learn and start your programming journey in! In Python you don't have to use excessive amounts of brackets or & or deal with many of the other syntax frustrations lower level langauges often introduce. Python is an interpreted langauge, which means that it's easy to modify programs and run them in real time, but the downside is this makes it significantly slower than a lower level compiled langauge like C or Fortran. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best of both worlds may lie in up and coming languages like Julia, which boast C-like performance but with higher-level Python syntax. Why learn Python then instead of something like Julia? It's still a little easier than Julia, but more importantly it is stabler and used more broadly across fields -- making Python perhaps ***the*** most useful language you can learn today. That being said I personally prefer Julia to Python and am happy to teach you that as well. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What can I use Python for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly anything! It's used for scientific research at universities and national labs (including NASA!) but it's also used extensively by web developers, game designers, and industry (in our area HP and Micron are two notable employers who use Python in their product development/testing). \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What will we be doing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introductory class I hope to introduce to you the foundational skills required to use Python (and other languages should you choose to learn them), specifically with applications to real science/modelling problems! No prior understanding of coding/science required--we will learn together as we go!"

Let's start by making sure you know how to open Jupyter notebook and saving your work to your personal folder (ask Mr. Shepard, me, or one of the TAs for help if you need it). You can make Python programs in any text editor and run them from the command line, something we might explore later, but for now we will work mostly out of notebooks for their ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
